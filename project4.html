        <h2> About grainjar</h2>
        <p>The growth of environmentally-conscious consumers, driving change especially in the last 5 years and during the COVID-19 pandemic inspired my team to create a strategic and sustainability-centered BULK cereal company which sells a set of curated, natural and ethically-sourced cereal. Our company aims to eliminate excessive plastic waste as well as opting for more eco-friendly packaging options such as cardboard and recycled plastic.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> The primary goals of our company are :</p>
        <ul>
          <li> breaking the stigma that cereal is exclusively a breakfast food (can be consumed any time of the day in a multitude of ways)</li>
          <li> encouraging everyday lifestyle changes to take small steps towards sustainability </li>
          <li> delivering a unique brand experience through our website and online presence </li>

        <h2> Target audience</h2>
        <p> According to a study by Mintel, millennials (aged 22-35) are more likely to have cereal as a snack and between meals. Furthermore, global data shows that millennials are driving the sustainable movement and they are most likely to pay extra for eco-friendly and sustainable products than any other age groups. After combining my research findings, we customized our brand to appeal to millennials who are vastly environmentally-conscious and most likely to have cereal more than once daily. </p>

      <h3> Brand identity</h3>
       <p> My team started off our design process by each creating a unique moodboard to consolidate a theme, color palette and mood we desired to establish in the website. To reflect the sustainable and organic image of the company, I chose a neutral color palette with brown and orange accents. </p>

   <section id ="pattern-library">

     <h3> Consolidating a pattern library</h3>
      <p> Next, we prototyped a style guide on Figma preliminary to individually building a final brand style guide for grainjar on HTML/CSS. To get a better sense of what style guides look like, we did additional research on brand style guides for websites. </p>

    <section id="sitemap">

        <h3> Laying out all the pages </h3>
        <p> My team created a sitemap to represent the relationships between pages and establish a hierarchy to efficiently sort pages according to their functionality. The "shopping cart" pages are differentiated in color from the rest of the pages. </p>

        <figure>

       <section id ="user-flow">

       <h3>Checkout user flow </h3>
       <p> After brainstorming through quick sketches on paper and establishing the sitemap for the website, we moved on to creating mid-fidelity wireframes on Figma. As an e-commerce website, the most time-consuming part was designing the checkout pages as they needed to be as concise as possible. We tried to envision the user flow early in the prototyping phase to ensure a seamless checkout experience for customers.  </p>

       <figure>
        <img class="myImages" src = "img/wireframes-grainjar.png" alt= "Mid-fidelity wireframes" width = "800">

       <figcaption> Final high-fidelity checkout mockup </figcaption>
     </figure>

     <p> One of the feedbacks we got during our in-class user testing is that there's a lack of hierarchy between the right and left columns as the fraction of both sides are relatively the same. We had a section to input the discount code on every page in checkout, but decided to only have it in the payment page as users expressed it was distracting to have it on every page. We also decided to add a box around the second and reduce its sizing to distinguish the content hierarchy between the left and right columns and ensure that it doesn't create any ambiguity or distractions in the checkout process. </p>

        <p> Each member of the team created a brand style guide unique to the website. It was important to create a reference tool in order to maintain consistency and facilitate the collaboration process when it comes to actually building the website. I built the style guide as well as UI modules such as the main navigation bar and product detail module using HTML/CSS. I included code snippets below each section as a reference.</p>

        <h2> Reflection </h2>
        <p> Designing a brand design system was a rewarding experience which allowed me to breakdown the web into modular UI components and prioritize consistency and accessibility across our prototypes. Not to mention, having a style guide has facilitated the collaboration process between my team mates, as establishing the basic interactive elements such as primary buttons and margins from the get-go was the key to success in working as efficiently as possibly when it came down to the most time-consuming, coding component of the project. </p>
