            <h4> Overview </h4>

            <p> For my IAT 339 class, I was given the task to prototype a responsive e-commerce website for a desired fictional company. My team decided to base our project on a cereal company where customers can buy their favorite organic and ethically-sourced in BULK through our website. </p>

           <h3> User goals </h3>
           <p> We established some of the user goals we wanted to consider and implement when prototyping our website. </p>
           <ul>
            <li> Quickly find what they are searching for </li>
            <li> Easily decide whether or not they like the companyâ€™s proposition to the customer </li>
            <li> Intuitively navigate through the website </li>
            <li> Identify consistent interactive cues throughout the website pages </li>
          </ul>

           <h3> Client goals </h3>
           <ul>
            <li> The client should be able to showcase their products to customers clearly and effectively </li>
            <li> The client should be able to communicate their ethos through design </li>
            <li> Allow the user to get to anywhere on the site through their current page location  </li>
            <li> Communicate a clear sustainable and organic image </li>
          </ul>

          <h2> Process </h2>
          <h3> 1. Moodboard</h3>
           <p> My team started off our design process by each creating a unique moodboard to consolidate a theme, color palette and mood we desired to establish in the website. To reflect the sustainable and oragnic image of the company, I chose a neutral color palette with brown and orange accents. </p>

           <figcaption> Moodboard created by me using a neutral color palette and earthy-tones </figcaption>
         </figure>

         <p> My teammate Clare had a divergent moodboard with a grudgy and bold theme. My team decided to move forward with my idea and Clare's as a secondary choice with goals to incorporate the darker theme somewhere in the website. </p>

         </figure>

         <h3> 2. Style guide prototype</h3>
          <p> Next, we had to prototype a style guide on Figma preliminary to individually building a final brand style guide for grainjar on HTML/CSS. To get a better sense of what style guides look like, we had to do additional research on brand style guides for websites. </p>

        </figure>

        <h3> 3. Sitemap </h3>
        <p> My team created a sitemap to represent the relationships between pages and establish a hierarchy to efficiently sort pages according to their function. The "shopping cart" pages are diffrentiated in color from the rest of the pages. </p>
        <figure>
          <img src = "img/sitemap2.jpg" alt= "sitemap" width = "700">

         </figure>

         <h3> 4. Crazy 8 Wireframes </h3>
         <p> After the initial ideation phase, my team had a mini crazy 8 design spring asynchronously. We tried to explore as many home page and products page layouts in a short time frame.</p>
         <figure>

         <figcaption> Low-fidelity wireframing </figcaption>
       </figure>

       <h3> 4. Wireframes </h3>
       <p> After brainstorming through quick sketches on paper, we moved on to creating high-fidelity wireframes on Figma. The most time consuming part was designing the checkout pages as they needed to be as concise as possible. </p>
       <figure>
       <img src = "img/wireframeg.jpg" alt= "wireframes" width = "800">
       <figcaption> High-fidelity wireframes </figcaption>
     </figure>

       <h3> 5. High-fidelity mockup </h3>
       <p> I explored different layouts by prototyping low/high-fidelity mockups on Figma and went through 3-4 iterations to establish a unique style for the website. One of the feedbacks I got from my TA in one of the crit sessions is the fact that my prototype looked too simple. In the following iteration, I tried to add more dynamic to the overall website. </p>

     <h2> Problem space </h2>
     <p> While brainstorming, we realized that if we sort according to their type and ingredients, many cereals would overlap in multiple categories, creating ambiguity.  </p>
   </div>
 </div>

 <div class = "main-container">
  <div class = "main-item">
     <h3> Solutions </h3>
     <p> As a result, we took an unconventional approach with sorting cereal. We organized them by different occasions rather than based on the different types and flavours. </p>

     <h3> Unique categories</h3>
     <ul>
      <li> Different banners </li>
      <li> Different background colors </li>
      <li> Unique layouts for each page </li>
      <li> Unique set of curated cereal </li>
    </ul> <p> </p>

    <h2> Designing a brand style guide </h2>
    <p> Each member of the team created a brand style guide unique to the website. It was important to create a reference tool in order to maintain consistency and facilitate the collaboration process when it comes to actually building the website. I built the style guide as well as UI modules such as the main navigation bar and product detail module using HTML/CSS. I included code snippets below each section as a reference.</p>
