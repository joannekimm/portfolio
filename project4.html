           <h3>Checkout user flow </h3>
           <p> After brainstorming through quick sketches on paper and establishing the sitemap for the website, we moved on to creating mid-fidelity wireframes on Figma. The most time consuming part was designing the checkout pages as they needed to be as concise as possible. We tried to envision the user flow for product checkout to ensure a seamless checkout process experience for customers.  </p>

         <p> One of the feedbacks we got during our in-class user testing is that there's a lack of hierarchy between the right and left columns as the fraction of both sides are relatively the same. We had a section to input the discount code on every page in checkout, but decided to only have it in the payment page as users expressed it was distracting to have it on every page. We also decided to add a box around the second and reduce its sizing to distinguish the content hierarchy between the left and right column and ensure that it doesn't create any ambiguity or distractions during checkout. </p>

            <h2> Reflection </h2>
            <p> Designing a brand design system was a rewarding experience which allowed me to breakdown the web into modular UI components and prioritize consistency and accessibility across our prototypes. Not to mention, having a style guide has facilitated the collaboration process between my team mates, as establishing the basic interactive elements such as primary buttons and margins from the get-go was the key to success in working as efficiently as possibly when it came down to the most time-consuming, coding component of the project. </p>
