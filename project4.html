            <p> For my IAT 339 class, I was given the task to prototype a responsive e-commerce website for a desired fictional company. My team decided to base our project on a cereal company where customers can buy their favorite organic and ethically-sourced in BULK through our website. </p>

          <h3> Brand identity</h3>
           <p> My team started off our design process by each creating a unique moodboard to consolidate a theme, color palette and mood we desired to establish in the website. To reflect the sustainable and oragnic image of the company, I chose a neutral color palette with brown and orange accents. </p>

         <p> My teammate Clare had a divergent moodboard with a grudgy and bold theme. My team decided to move forward with my idea and Clare's as a secondary choice with goals to incorporate the darker theme somewhere in the website. </p>

         <h3> Consolidating a pattern library</h3>
          <p> Next, we had to prototype a style guide on Figma preliminary to individually building a final brand style guide for grainjar on HTML/CSS. To get a better sense of what style guides look like, we had to do additional research on brand style guides for websites. </p>

            <h3> Laying out all the pages </h3>
            <p> My team created a sitemap to represent the relationships between pages and establish a hierarchy to efficiently sort pages according to their function. The "shopping cart" pages are diffrentiated in color from the rest of the pages. </p>

           <h3>Checkout user flow </h3>
           <p> After brainstorming through quick sketches on paper and establishing the sitemap for the website, we moved on to creating mid-fidelity wireframes on Figma. The most time consuming part was designing the checkout pages as they needed to be as concise as possible. We tried to envision the user flow for product checkout to ensure a seamless checkout process experience for customers.  </p>

            <h2> Designing a design system </h2>
            <p> Each member of the team created a brand style guide unique to the website. It was important to create a reference tool in order to maintain consistency and facilitate the collaboration process when it comes to actually building the website. I built the style guide as well as UI modules such as the main navigation bar and product detail module using HTML/CSS. I included code snippets below each section as a reference.</p>

            <h2> Basic interactive elements</h2>
            <p> Basic interactive elements such as the button styling were established in the pattern library prior to building the website and is used across the entire website to ensure consistency at all times. The button padding, sizes, margins, colours and functionalities are outlined in the pattern library.</p>

            <h3> Call to action buttons </h3>
            <p> Buttons are interactive elements which communicate and triger an action. On the grainjar website, there are 4 different types of buttons- primary which is used for “add to cart” buttons, secondary buttons used for “read more” buttons and disabled buttons for selecting flavours in product detail modules. </p>

            <h3>Anatomy</h3>
            <p>All the default buttons used at grainjar are center-aligned. In the case that an icon is used in secondary buttons, the text is left-aligned.</p>

            <h3>Button size</h3>
            <p>There are 3 different button sizes at grainjar. The buttons used for forms are longer than the default buttons. All the buttons use padding: 8px 28px 8px 28px, a border-radius of 3px and a 0.9em font-size.</p>

              <h2> Reflection </h2>
              <p> Designing a brand design system was a rewarding experience which allowed me to breakdown the web into modular UI components and prioritize consistency and accessibility across our prototypes. Not to mention, having a style guide has facilitated the collaboration process between my team mates, as establishing the basic interactive elements such as primary buttons and margins from the get-go was the key to success in working as efficiently as possibly when it came down to the most time-consuming, coding component of the project. </p>
