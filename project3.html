                <h3> Overview </h3>
                <p> With the recent escalation of COVID-19 cases, it had become apparent that people aren't fully educated on the number of cases in their area, so my team and I decided to base our hackathon project on COVID-19 hotspot trackers. Amidst the growing concerns and fear of transmission within the community, we thought it was important for users to know which stores have been affected by COVD-19 in real time. We decided it was best to create a Google Chrome extension which shows directly on the map, if stores have reported cases of coronavirus. </p>

                <h3> Brainstorming </h3>
                 <img src = "img/brainstorm.jpg" alt= "prototype 1" width = "750">

                 <h3> Prototype </h3>
                 <p> Our team used a bold red colour to emphasize the COVID-19 alert cues on the map and hover overlays to indicate the stores that have been affected recently. </p>
                  <img src = "img/covid3.jpg" alt= "prototype 1" width = "600"> <br>
                   <img src = "img/project3.jpg" alt= "prototype 1" width = "600"> <br>
                    <img src = "img/covid.jpg" alt= "prototype 1" width = "600">

                      <h3> Challenges </h3>
                      <p> Our team only consisted of designers and didnâ€™t have any developers so we were all very new to JavaScript and front-end development. After watching multiple Youtube turorial, we were able to create a mockup for this Google Chrome extension using Javascript.  </p>

                      <h3> Future explorations </h3>
                      <p> In the futures, implementing proper user testing would give us a better insight on what kind of other COVID-19 related information is lacking in the community. We would also like to optimize the front-end and implement a sorting/searching program that can find out the publicly-released COVID articles that are related to the specific location. </p>
