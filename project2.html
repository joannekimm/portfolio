          <h2 class ="margin-header"> App design process </h2>

           <h3> App style guide</h3>

           <p> I kickstarted my design process by creating a style guide for future designers to reference from. Despite being the only UX/ UI designer on the team, it was important for me to not only verbally, but visually present my ideas to the team in weekly check-ins. My team decided to opt for an orange color palette for the first iteration to reflect BYO's fresh and innovative ethos. </p>
           <figure>
           <img src = "img/byo-styleguide.png" alt= "styleguide" width = "650">
           <figcaption> Style guide prototype for BYO </figcaption>
           </figure>

           <h3> Understanding the user flow </h3>

           <p> At first glance, it was a little bit confusing to grasp the concept of having to claim the reward first in order to redeem it afterwards by using the scan button. As the BYO app is a reward based application, it was especially important for my team, especially back-end developers to clearly understand the reward-claiming process. </p>
           <figure>
           <img src = "img/flowchart.png" alt= "user flowchart" width = "600">
           <figcaption> User flowchart for rewards </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <!--

          <h3> Logged in vs not logged in </h3>

          <p> Our team decided to have two different versions of the dashboard -one that appears right after the splash screen which does not show the user's impact and only displays BYO's collective impact (number of cups saved/ trees planted) and another version for when the user signs up or logs into their account. The reason why we decided to have an impact dashboard right after the splash screen was because we wanted users to be able to directly see the dashboard and see the BYO vision and how the app works before having to go through the whole sign-up process which is time consuming. </p>

          </figure> -->

          <h3> Impact dashboard low-fi</h3>

          <p> For the dashboard prototype, I focused on exploring different layout options for the app through quick 12-minute low-fidelity wireframe design sprints. </p>

          <figure>

          <h3>Wireframing + user flow</h3>

          <p> For the second prototype, I focused on creating a more sophisticated design while considering some important UX aspects. The third prototype is still a work in progress and the app will launch after re-iterating a workable prototype. </p>

          </figure>

          <h3>Layout exploration </h3>

          <p> Brainstorming the graphical elements for the home screen was the most challenging part of this project. My team wanted to put emphasis on displaying the user's meaningful impact on reducing waste through graphics. Although this is still a work-in-progress, my team will continue to explore different ways to emphasize the feeling of personal accomplishment from reducing disposable cup waste through visual representations. </p>

          <p> We decided to add a transparent pop-up message and red borders instead, which would disappear after a few seconds and allow users to continue scanning while the message is still in display. In the case that the QR code is invalid and not provided by a cafe with the BYO program, "QR code invalid" message will pop up.</p>

             <h2> Final thoughts </h2>

               <p> Being the only UX designer on the team and building an entire app from scratch with no experience in app design and limited resources was very challenging. However this was a one-of-a-kind experience- I'm glad I took the initiative to create feasible prototypes and experience collaborating with developers for the first time. <br> <br>

               After the Beta Launch happening this summer, I plan to do focus user group testing and gather important user feedback to enhance the UI of the app as well as implementing a seamless reward claiming/ redeeming process which is a primary feature of the BYO app.</p>
