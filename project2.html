              <h4> Overview </h4>

              <p> Every minute, Vancouver throws out an average of 258 disposable cups amounting to over 130 million cups annually. BYO is a mobile app-based program where customers who bring their own cups to local cafes can collect points towards rewards while contributing to global reforestation efforts by allocating a part of their usual discount to tree planting. </p>

        <h2 class ="byo"> App launch details</h2>
        <p> The app will have a total of 2 launches planned for the year 2021. The beta launch for usability testing will only consist of the login pages, impact dashboard and in-store scanning pages. The second version of the app will have more complex features such as the rewards library and shop profiles.</p>

          <h2>Problem space </h2>

          <p> Every minute, Vancouver throws out an average of 258 disposable cups amounting to over 130 million cups annually. Current incentives for bring-yourown-cup, such as small in-store discounts and cup surcharges, are minimal and struggle encourage large change.</p>

          <h2> Solution </h2>

          <p> BYO is a mobile app-based program where customers who bring their own cups to local cafes can collect points towards rewards while contributing to global reforestation efforts by allocating a part of their usual discount to tree planting.</p>

         </figure>

          <h3> Target audience </h3>
          <p> Metro Vancouverites who sometimes / often buy to-go drinks and are interested in taking small steps towards sustainability. </p>

          <h3> User goals </h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Customers can track and amplify their collective environmental action, achieving a sense of personal <br> accomplishment </li>
            <li> Join the reuse movement, achieving a sense of community and collective action </li>
            <li> Take advantage of discounts and free rewards </li>
            <li> Building a sustainability-centered network </li>
          </ul>

        <h2> Competitive analysis</h2>
        <p> In the second version of the BYO app, we plan on implementing a rewards library where users can collect and redeem their rewards. We researched assessed existing competitors to identify and compare key features. Efforts have been implemented to reduce disposable cups but none have leveraged bring-your-own-cup collectively. Secondly, current reward apps that exist in the restaurant industry are mostly based on the traditional premise of transactional loyalty.</p>

         <figcaption> Competitive analysis of local competitors </figcaption>
         </figure>

         <p> For BYO, instead of using solely rewards to incentivize consumers, our tree planting aspect seeks to connect consumers to a broader global impact. From our research, we believe relationships between customers and businesses have the power to shape communities â€” there's something more than just increasing sales. Because there is no app on the market that recognizes this, we want to create one that leverages these grassroots connections to drive change.</p>

        <h2> Website redesign </h2>
        <h3> Old BYO website</h3>

        <p> The original BYO website was outdated, dull and lacked content. The founders of BYO asked me to redesign the current website while focusing on brand identity and re-formatting the content. Despite having a very short time frame of one week, I was able to quickly prototype a high-fidelity mockup on figma and edit the website on wordpress. Although I am more comfortable with coding on HTML/CSS, we decided as a team that it would be best for the founders to access and edit the website in the future if used Wordpress as they don't have any experience with web development. However, I ended up implementing quite a lot of css styling to fully customize the website. </p>

         <figure>
         <img src = "img/oldbyo.jpg" alt= "old byo website" width = "800">
         <figcaption> Old and oudated BYO website </figcaption>
         </figure>

         <p> The old BYO website didn't feel inviting and displayed minimal information about the company itself and their mission and primarily focused on conveying the problem space. We decided to move the problem space element down in the home page hierarchy of content and elaborate more on answering the questions "who" and "why" for BYO so that users can get a better idea of what BYO is and how it works immediately upon landing on the home page. </p>

         <h3> BYO website re-imagined </h3>

         <p> The website design was inspired by the pattern library designed for the BYO app and the app dashboard that is currently in the process of being built. The founders of BYO emphasized wanting a more "fun" "inviting" amd lively" look for the website which I tried to amplify using lighter colours and fun graphic accents. </p>

         </figure>

         <h2> App design process </h2>

         <h3> 1. Style guide</h3>

         <p> I kickstarted my design process by creating a style guide for future designers to reference from. Despite being the only UX/ UI designer on the team, it was important for me to not only verbally, but visually present my ideas to the team in weekly check-ins. My team decided to opt for an orange color palette for the first iteration to reflect BYO's fresh and innovative ethos. </p>

         <figcaption> Style guide prototype for BYO </figcaption>
         </figure>

         <h3> 2. User flowchart </h3>

         <p> At first glance, it was a little bit confusing to grasp the concept of having to claim the reward first in order to redeem it afterwards by using the scan button. As the BYO app is a reward based application, it was especially important for my team, especially back-end developers to clearly understand the reward-claiming process. In order to create a more feasible and improve user flowchart, I hope to create personas and implement user testing in the second iteration of the app. </p>
         <figure>
         <img src = "img/flowchartv1.jpg" alt= "user flowchart" width = "600">
         <figcaption> User flowchart for rewards </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3> Logged in vs not logged in </h3>

        <p> Our team decided to have two different versions of the dashboard -one that appears right after the splash screen which does not show the user's impact and only displays BYO's collective impact (number of cups saved/ trees planted) and another version for when the user signs up or logs into their account. The reason why we decided to have an impact dashboard right after the splash screen was because we wanted users to be able to directly see the dashboard and see the BYO vision and how the app works before having to go through the whole sign-up process which is time consuming. </p>

        </figure> -->

        <h3> 3. Dashboard low-fidelity wireframes</h3>

        <p> For the dashboard prototype, I focused on exploring different layout options for the app through quick 12-minute low-fidelity wireframe design sprints. </p>
        <figure>
        <img src = "img/impact.jpg" alt= "prototype 1" width = "750">

        </figure>

        <h3> 4. High-fidelity mockup </h3>

        <p> For the second prototype,  I focused on creating a more sophisticated design while considering some important UX aspects. The third prototype is still a work in progress and the app will launch after re-iterating a workable prototype. </p>
        <figure>

        <figcaption> High-fidelity mockup (work-in-progress) </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>5. Graphic design explorations </h3>

        <p> Brainstorming the graphical elements for the home screen was the most challenging part of this project. My team wanted to put emphasis on displaying the user's meaningful impact on reducing waste through graphics. Although this is still a work-in-progress, my team will continue to explore different ways to emphasize the feeling of personal accomplishment from reducing disposable cup waste through visual representations. </p>

         <figcaption> Layout explorations prototype </figcaption>
       </figure>

        <h3> Key features </h3>

        <p> Some of the key features include the floating scan button which is accessible on every page of the app as well as the rewards page which allows users to redeem or claim points. </p>
        <figure>
        <img src = "img/feature.jpg" alt = "key feature" width = "400">
        <figcaption> Floating button feature </figcaption>
      </figure>

        <h3> Challenges </h3>

        <p> Another challenge was trying to figure out the user flow in the initial stages of the protoype without actually doing 
        formal user testing. As our app may be confusing, especially for first-time users, it was really important to consider usability testing for the next iteration, making sure that users could easily understand how to navigate through the app. </p>

        <h3> Future explorations for v2 </h3>

        <p> Implementing shop profiles and a reward library will be the primary focus for v2 of the BYO app. Adding shop profiles is important for users to understand the unique shop policies and discounts per cup/ cup size which varies from store to store. During my team's weekly check-ins, I suggested to implement user profiles in order to give users a more personalized experience and provide the option to claim/redeem their rewards separately. </p>

           <h2> Final thoughts </h2>

             <p> Being the only UX designer on the team and building an entire app from scratch with no experience in app design and limited resources was very challenging. However this was a one-of-a-kind experience- I'm glad I took the initiative to create feasible prototypes and experience collaborating with developers for the first time. <br> <br>

             For the final prototype, I plan on conducting user testing as well as implementing a little graphical guide after the launch screen which demonstrates how to use the app to first time users. The login process may be moved back in the order of presentation as it may be a potential barrier for users to access the content of the app right away when launching the app. </p>
