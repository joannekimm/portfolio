        <h2>Problem Space </h2>

        <p> Every minute, Vancouver throws out an average of 258 disposable cups amounting to over 130 million cups annually. Current incentives for bring-your-own-cup, such as small in-store discounts and cup surcharges, are minimal and struggle to encourage large change.</p>

        <h6> RESEARCH </h6>
        <h2> Understanding sustainability trends </h2>
        <p> Before establishing the rewards program, I wanted to gain a better insight on the problem of single use waste in Metro Vancouver and ways we can leverage to mitigate the issue. Priscilla and Angie, the founders of BYO have done both primary and secondary research in which I was able to gain lots of valuable insights.</p>

      <h2> Convenience Culture </h2>
      <p> Under our current capitalist system, convenience culture has been normalized in the food and beverage industry and exacerbated by the contemporary hustle attitude. From mobile ordering to delivery apps to takeout, our modern-day society prioritizes speed under a false narrative that everything needs to operate at its maximum efficiency even if it comes at the expense of human and environmental health. Hence, tackling the single-use waste problem would require us to rethink our systems of convenience and understand the underlying drivers of convenience. Ultimately, there is no way for us to achieve a circular economy while maintaining this status quo</p>

      <h3> Stakeholder Analysis</h3>
      <p>At the surface level, customers are the ones ordering food in single-use takeout containers and thus, contributing to the waste issue. Interestingly, a 2018 City of Vancouver survey shows that most people are wanting to reduce their waste. Based on our interviews, a major barrier to this is convenience. People are reluctant to change their behaviours if the alternative is not as accessible and easy to do (effectively maintaining the convenience culture status quo).</p>

      <h3> What is stopping people from changing their habits?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Lack of awareness on an individual level about the severity of our waste issue </li>
        <li> sustained by the belief that recycling and compostables are sufficient </li>
        <li> lack of education</li>
        <li> elongated supply chains divorce individuals from the realities of production, consumption, and disposal</li>
        <li> failure to internalize our waste issue even when we are cognizant of its severity</li>
        <li>out of sight, out of mind attitude</li>
      </ul>

    <h2> Competitive analysis</h2>

    <p>We researched and assessed existing competitors in Metro-Vancouver to understand current market trends and identify/compare key features. Despite the fact that there are multiple apps with reward programs for bringing your own cup, most of them solely relied on rewards to incentivize customers. </p>

       <h3> Key takeaways</h3>

          <li> Efforts have been implemented to reduce disposable cups but none have leveraged bring-your-own-cup collectively </li>

        <h3> Amplifying user impact</h3>

         <p> For BYO, instead of using solely rewards to incentivize consumers, our tree planting aspect (planting a tree for every 5 cups saved) seeks to connect consumers to a broader global impact and shape a community. Because there is no app on the market that recognizes this, we wanted to create one that leverages these grassroots connections to drive change.</p>

    <h6> PROBLEM </h6>
    <h2>Current Reward Library </h2>

     <h3 class = "top"> Doesn't reflect our core initiative</h3>

     <p> Our initial ideation of the reward library didn't reflect the primary goals of BYO and the founders wanted to improve our market positioning. We wanted our reward system to cater towards the sustainability-curious customers, our target users and demonstrate a propensity for alternatives and have high aspirational values. </p>
     <figure>
     <img src = "img/reward-byo.svg" alt= "reward library" width = "800">
     <figcaption> Current reward library </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3> Not sustainable </h3>
    <p> The logistics of implementing the rewards on the development side was a lot complicated than anticipated. Building a regular earn-and-burn point system will require us to constantly seek reward partners and keep the reward library stocked. The market for this kind of reward system is already saturated and we watned to provide something different and special users. </p>

    <h6> IDEATION </h6>
    <h2>Ideating a unique reward system </h2>
    <h3 class = "top"> Shifting directions </h3>
    <p> In order to reflect our new direction towards creating more sustained habitual change rather than primarily incentivizing users through our rewards program, we ideated a 3 tier system.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src = "img/byo-flow.svg" alt= "new user flow" width = "850">
      <figcaption> New rewards user flow </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3> 3-Tier system </h3>
    <p> BYO's goal is changing social norms and perceptions around the reuse culture. Since a lot of a sustainability behaviour change research we've done show that social cues play a huge part. We want to leverage community and a sense of exclusivity, being part of an in-crowd through this new rewards system. Getting exclusive rewards hits differently than a regular earn-and-burn system, you feel like you’re getting special treatment.</p>

    <section id = "usertesting">
    <h2> User Testing </h2>
      <p> Early in the ideation phase, my team ran a usability testing session with 5 Beta Test Users to test out different prototypes of the rewards library and impact dashboard. The purpose of this session was to test out the new reward program. My team presented 2 different mockups of our impact dashboard UI and the reward program to users. The first prototype focuses more on the user impact as users can directly see how many cups they need to save to plant the next tree in the progress bar.In terms of the rewards library, depending on which tier the user is in, the applicable rewards are active and the non-applicable rewards are greyed out. However, users noted that the reward program was unintuitive and most of them didn't realize that it was based on a 3 tier system.</p>

         <figcaption> Prototype 1 - Impact-based progress bar </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The second prototype emphasizes the tier system of the rewards program more as the progress bar indicates how many cups the user needs to save to reach the next tier. Although users can easily identify which tier they belong in and how the system works, users can't see how many cups they need to save to plant the next tree unless they tap on the "your impact card". Overall, users were in favour of the first prototype more and my team agreed that it aligned with our core values best.</p>

    <section id ="after">


    <h2> Distinguishing between tiers </h2>

    <p> How might we establish a visual contrast between tiers 1,2 and 3 without taking away from our efforts to leverage community and positivity? After the user testing sessions, my team braindstormed ways to find the middle ground between the 1st and 2nd prototype as well as coming up with visual cues which allows users to easily identify which tier they are in. While it was important for users to get a sense of exclusivity, it wasn't our goal to turn this app into a tier-driven initiative. We wanted to ensure that it was intuitive enough for users to know which tier they are in while still focusing on tracking their environmental impact in our dashboard.</p>

     <figure>
         <img src = "img/tier.png" alt= "3 tier system" width = "800">
         <figcaption> 3 tier system </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </section>


    <h2> Final iteration </h2>

    <p> It was really important for us to ensure that the tier system was very intuitive in the rewards library so we added an interactive status card at the very top as well as greying out the rewards that are non-applicable to the users' current tier status. Furthermore, in the final iteration, my team focused on making components within the app more interactive. When users tap on the first card, it indicates the different tier systems used at BYO. We decided on more approachable languaging - "Sprout", "Sapling" and "Tree" to replace the "tier" terminology.</p>

         <figcaption> 3 Tier system in the rewards library </figcaption>
      </figure>

    <h3> Amplifying user impact </h3>

     <p> While we decided to keep the progress bar which shows how many more cups need to be saved to plant the next tree, we thought it was a good idea to keep the "your impact cards" interactive so that users (especially first-time users) can learn more about the impact they are making through a little pop up card. </p>

         <figcaption> Interactive cards to amplify user impact </figcaption>
      </figure>

    <h3> Friends impact feature </h3>

    <p> Including a friends feature was a popular request from our beta testers. As our app strives to incentivize community impact, we wanted to implement a feature where users can track their friends' progress. This not only helps users keep each other accountable in an approachable way, but also helps to spread the word by inviting new users to use the app and join the BYO movement.</p>

           <h2> Reflection </h2>

             <p> I was only a first year student with very limited design experience when I started this project and I could've never imagined leading the design team and collaborating with developers to actually ship the BYO app on the app store/ google play one day. My team had to go through so many design iterations to ensure that it reflected our stakeholders' visions as well as users' and although leveraging between the two was hard at times, this was honestly one of the most rewarding experiences to date. Throughout this journey, I learned to advocate my design decisions to people from different areas of expertise with minimal user experience design and that helped me reflect on the design choices I make more critically and practice verbally communicating my design decisions.</p>

             <p> One thing I would do differently next time is to interview a bigger sample of users so that I can actually do an A/B test of the two different prototypes I made of the impact dashboard UI and reward library. Generally, as more users start to use our app in real life settings, I would love to interview users to see whether our app was successful in leveraging community rather than incentivizing solely with our rewards system. If unsuccessful, I would love to gather feedback and brainstorm ways to optimize the user experience in a way that reflects our core values.</p>
