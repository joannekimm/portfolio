        <h2>Problem Space </h2>

        <p> Every minute, Vancouver throws out an average of 258 disposable cups amounting to over 130 million cups annually. Current incentives for bring-your-own-cup, such as small in-store discounts and cup surcharges, are minimal and struggle to encourage large change.</p>

        <h6> RESEARCH </h6>
        <h2> Understanding sustainability trends </h2>
        <p> Before establishing the rewards program, I wanted to gain a better insights on the problem of single use waste in Metro Vancouver and ways we can leverage to mitigate the issue. Priscilla and Angie, the founders of BYO have done both primary and secondary research in which I was able to gain lots of valuable insights.</p>

      <h3> Convenience Culture </h3>
      <p> Under our current capitalist system, convenience culture has been normalized in the food and beverage industry and exacerbated by the contemporary hustle attitude. From mobile ordering to delivery apps to takeout, our modern-day society prioritizes speed under a false narrative that everything needs to operate at its maximum efficiency even if it comes at the expense of human and environmental health. Hence, tackling the single-use waste problem would require us to rethink our systems of convenience and understand the underlying drivers of convenience. Ultimately, there is no way for us to achieve a circular economy while maintaining this status quo</p>

      <h3> Stakeholder Analysis</h3>
      <p>At the surface level, customers are the ones ordering food in single-use takeout containers and thus, contributing to the waste issue. Interestingly, a 2018 City of Vancouver survey shows that most people are wanting to reduce their waste. Based on our interviews, a major barrier to this is convenience. People are reluctant to change their behaviours if the alternative is not as accessible and easy to do (effectively maintaining the convenience culture status quo).</p>

      <h3> What is stopping people from changing their habits?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Lack of awareness on an individual level about the severity of our waste issue </li>
        <li> sustained by the belief that recycling and compostables are sufficient </li>
        <li> lack of education</li>
        <li> elongated supply chains divorce individuals from the realities of production, consumption, and disposal</li>
        <li> failure to internalize our waste issue even when we are cognizant of its severity</li>
        <li> trading off waste for time </li>
        <li>out of sight, out of mind attitude</li>
      </ul>

      <div class ="grid-item">

      <h3> User Persona </h3>
      <p> We developed 2 personas based on the surveys we ran of our beta test group consumers. Julie, the BYOCer embodies the customers that bring their cups on a regular basis and takes initiative to reduce carbon footprint and the occasional BYOCer, Kelly who sometimes brings her own cup and sometimes feel embarassed.</p>

        <h3> Amplifying user impact</h3>

         <p> For BYO, instead of using solely rewards to incentivize consumers, our tree planting aspect seeks to connect consumers to a broader global impact and shape a community. Because there is no app on the market that recognizes this, we want to create one that leverages these grassroots connections to drive change.</p>

    <h6> PROBLEM </h6>
    <h2>Current Reward Library </h2>

     <h3> Doesn't reflect our core initiative</h3>

     <p> Our initial ideation of the reward library didn't reflect the primary goals of BYO and the founders wanted to improve our market positioning. We want our reward system to cater towards the sustainability-curious customers, our target users and demonstrate a propensity for alternatives and have high aspirational values. </p>
     <figure>
     <img src = "img/reward-byo.svg" alt= "reward library" width = "800">
     <figcaption> Current reward library </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3> Not sustainable </h3>
    <p> The logistics of implementing the rewards on the development side was a lot complicated than anticipated. Building a regular earn-and-burn point system will require us to constantly seek reward partners and keep the reward library stocked. The market for this kind of reward system is already saturated and we watned to provide something different and special users. </p>
  </section>


  <section id ="new-reward">
    <h6> IDEATION </h6>
    <h2>Ideating a unique reward system </h2>
    <h3> Shifting directions </h3>
    <p> In order to reflect our new direction towards creating more sustained habitual change rather than primarily incentivizing users through our rewards program, we ideated a 3 tier system.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src = "img/byo-flow.svg" alt= "new user flow" width = "850">
      <figcaption> New rewards user flow </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3> 3-Tier system </h3>
    <p> BYO's goal is changing social norms and perceptions around the reuse culture. Since a lot of a sustainability behaviour change research we've done show that social cues play a huge part. We want to leverage community and a sense of exclusivity, being part of an in-crowd through this new rewards system. Getting exclusive rewards hits differently than a regular earn-and-burn system, you feel like youâ€™re getting special treatment.</p>

        <figure>
         <img src = "img/3tier.png" alt= "3 tier system" width = "800">
         <figcaption> 3 tier system </figcaption>
        </figure>


    <h3> Distinguishing between tiers </h3>

    <p> How might we establish a visual contrast between tiers 1,2 and 3 without taking away from our efforts to leverage community and positivity? While it was important for users to get a sense of exclusivity, it wasn't our goal to turn this app into a tier-driven initiative. We wanted to ensure that it was intuitive enough for users to know which tier they are in while still focusing on tracking their environmental impact in our dashboard.</p>

         <img src = "img/tier.png" alt= "3 tier system" width = "800">
         <figcaption> 3 tier system </figcaption>
        </figure>

    <h3> How might we amplify user impact? </h3>

     <p> Instead of having a progress bar which shows how many cups they need to save in order to plant the next tree, we decided to change it into a tier progress bar. In contrast, we decided to make the "your impact" cards interactive so that users can learn more about the impact they are making through a little pop up card. </p>

         <figcaption> Interactive cards to amplify user impact </figcaption>
      </figure>

    <h3> Wireframing the interaction </h3>

    <p> I created interactive wireframes to contextualize the new designs and understand how the tier system will be integrated into the dashboard and the reward library.</p>

         <img src = "img/sap.png" alt= "reward library" width = "800">
         <figcaption> 3 Tier system in the rewards library </figcaption>
      </figure>

    <h2> Friends impact feature </h2>

    <p> Including a friends feature was a popular request from our beta testers. As our app strives to incentivize community impact, we wanted to implement a feature where users can track their friends' progress. This not only helps users keep each other accountable in an approachable way, but also helps to spread the word by inviting new users to use the app and join the BYO movement.  </p>

         <figcaption> 3 tier system </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2> Usability Testing </h2>
      <p> My team ran a usability testing session with 5 Beta Test Users to test out different prototypes of the rewards library and impact dashboard. Despite the fact that we had a considerably small sample size of user testers due to the fact that specifically recruited beta test users, the majority of the users said that they wanted to see the progress bar on the home page so they can keep track of how many cups they need to save until the next reward.</p>

           <h2> Final thoughts </h2>

             <p>Working in a cross-functional team allowed me to gain more insight about important elements of implementation which translates differently from initial design iterations in some instances. At times, I had to advocate my design decisions to people from different areas of expertise with minimal user experience design and that helped me reflect on the design choices I make more critically.</p>
