              <h4> Overview </h4>

              <p> Every minute, Vancouver throws out an average of 258 disposable cups amounting to over 130 million cups annually. The founder of BYO came to SFU Surge with goals to prototype and ultimately develop a mobile app-based program where customers who bring their own cups to local cafes can collect points towards rewards while contributing to global reforestation efforts by allocating a part of their usual discount to tree planting. </p>

        <h2> Website redesign </h2>
        <h3> Before </h3>

        <p> The original BYO website was outdated, dull and lacked content. The founders of BYO asked me to redesign the current website while focusing on brand identity and re-formatting the content. Despite having a very short time frame of one week, I was able to quickly prototype a high-fidelity mockup on figma and edit the website on wordpress. Although I am more comfortable with coding on HTML/CSS, we decided as a team that it would be best for the founders to access and edit the website in the future if used wordpress as they don't have any experience with web development. </p>

         </figure>

         <h3> After </h3>

         <p> The website design was inspired by the pattern library designed for the BYO app and the app dashboard that is currently in the process of being built. The founders of BYO emphasized wanting a more "fun" and "lively" look for the website which I tried to amplify using lighter colours and fun graphic accents. </p>

         </figure>

         <h2> App design process </h2>

         <h3> 1. Style guide</h3>

         <p> I kickstarted my design process by creating a style guide for future designers to reference from. Despite being the only UX/ UI designer on the team, it was important for me to not only verbally, but visually present my ideas to the team in weekly check-ins. My team decided to opt for an orange color palette for the first iteration to reflect BYO's fresh and innovative ethos. </p>

         <figcaption> Style guide prototype for BYO </figcaption>
         </figure>

         <h3> 2. User flowchart </h3>

         <p> At first glance, it was a little bit confusing to grasp the concept of having to claim the reward first in order to redeem it afterwards by using the scan button. As the BYO app is a reward based application, it was especially important for my team, especially back-end developers to clearly understand the reward-claiming process. In order to create a more feasible and improve user flowchart, I hope to create personas and implement user testing in the second iteration of the app. </p>
         <figure>
         <img src = "img/flowchart.jpg" alt= "user flowchart" width = "700">
         <figcaption> User flowchart for rewards </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> Users must claim the reward before being able to scan and redeem it in-stores. Once a reward is claimed, it can be used later at the user's convenience. Claiming the reward in advance prevents users from missing the reward, as each store only has a limited amount of promotions. </p>

       </figure>

        <h3> 3. Low-fidelity mockup</h3>

        <p> For the first prototype, I focused on implementing the important features, exploring some layout structures and selecting a colour palette for the app. </p>
        <figure>
        <img src = "img/pro1.jpg" alt= "prototype 1" width = "700">
        <figcaption> Low-fidelity mockup </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3> 4. High-fidelity mockup </h3>

        <p> For the second prototype,  I focused on creating a more sophisticated design while considering some important UX aspects. The third prototype is still a work in progress and the app will launch after re-iterating a workable prototype. </p>
        <figure>
        <img src = "img/pro2.jpg" alt= "prototype 2" width = "700">
        <figcaption> High-fidelity mockup (work-in-progress) </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>5. Layout explorations </h3>

        <p> Brainstorming the layout of the home screen was the most challenging part of this project. My team wanted to put emphasis on displaying the user's meaningful impact on reducing waste through graphics. Although this is still a work-in-progress, my team will continue to explore different ways to emphasize the feeling of personal accomplishment from reducing disposable cup waste through visual representations. </p>

         <img src = "img/layout.jpg" alt= "layout" width = "700">
         <figcaption> Layout explorations prototype </figcaption>
       </figure>

        <h3> Key features </h3>

        <p> Some of the key features include the floating scan button which is accessible on every page of the app as well as the rewards page which allows users to redeem or claim points. </p>
        <figure>
        <img src = "img/feature.jpg" alt = "key feature" width = "400">
        <figcaption> Floating button feature </figcaption>
      </figure>

        <h3> Challenges </h3>

        <p> Another challenge was trying to figure out the user flow in the initial stages of the protoype without actually doing 
        formal user testing. As our app may be confusing, especially for first-time users, it was really important to consider usability testing for the next iteration, making sure that users could easily understand how to navigate through the app. </p>

        <h3> Implementing profiles </h3>

        <p> Implementing shop profiles was important for users to understand the unique shop policies and discounts per cup/ cup size which varies from store to store. During my team's weekly check-ins, I suggested to implement user profiles in order to give users a more personalized experience and provide the option to claim/redeem their rewards separately. </p>
        <figure>
            <img src = "img/profiles.jpg" alt= "me" width = "700">

           <h3> Final thoughts </h3>

             <p> Being the only UX designer on the team and building an entire app from scratch with no experience in app design and limited resources was very challenging. However this was a one-of-a-kind experience- I'm glad I took the initiative to create feasible prototypes and experience collaborating with developers for the first time. <br> <br>

             For the final prototype, I plan on conducting user testing as well as implementing a little graphical guide after the launch screen which demonstrates how to use the app to first time users. The login process may be moved back in the order of presentation as it may be a potential barrier for users to access the content of the app right away when launching the app. </p>
